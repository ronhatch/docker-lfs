# Docker-LFS
Building a Linux from Scratch system (version 11.2) while deviating from the book by doing everything in Docker containers and packaging the results so that it can easily be installed on multiple systems. (Linux from Scratch is available at https://linuxfromscratch.org.)

Primarily a learning project, but also intended to provide a usable minimal Linux system that I can customize.
